============

Version 1.0.1.11 (2010-04-25)
-----------------------------
- Worked around index sync issue with buggy FDCs by avoiding size=0


Version 1.0.1.10 [refresh] (2008-12-21)
---------------------------------------
- FdInstall.dll is no longer UPX-compressed, to avoid a virus false-positive
- ALL installation message boxes are now suppressed during silent installation


Version 1.0.1.10 (2008-09-29)
-----------------------------
- Sector size codes >= 8 now treated as 32K
- Added IOCTL_FD_CHECK_DISK and IOCTL_FD_GET_TRACK_TIME
- IOCTL_FDCMD_FORMAT_AND_WRITE now implemented for compatible FDCs


Version 1.0.1.9 [refresh 2] (2007-01-05)
----------------------------------------
- UPX no longer used to compress installer, to avoid virus scanner false-positive


Version 1.0.1.9 [refresh] (2006-12-27)
--------------------------------------
- Single installer for both x86 and x64 platforms
- Added support for Windows Vista
- Driver code unchanged in this release, so no version number change


Version 1.0.1.9 (2006-05-07)
----------------------------
- A motor timeout of 0 seconds can now be used to prevent the motor switching off


Version 1.0.1.8 (2006-03-30)
----------------------------
- Fixed short-write start race condition on SMP/HyperThreaded systems


Version 1.0.1.7 (2006-03-15)
----------------------------
- Fixed legacy FD_SCAN_TRACK use, which sometimes needed recalibration before seeking
- Fixed raw reads failing to start if the request size was above the DMA limit
- Fixed possible crash if control device was open during driver restart/update


Version 1.0.1.6 (2006-03-12)
----------------------------
- Fixed large raw-read transfer crash on AMD64
- Fixed track wrap error in layout scanning when first sector is close to index hole


Version 1.0.1.4 (2006-03-08)
----------------------------
- Added raw track reading support using Disk2FDI's 2 drive method
- Fixed acquire-only commands holding on to the controller if motor was off


Version 1.0.1.2 (2006-02-05)
----------------------------
- Changed default motor timeout to 2 seconds
- Default controller settings are now restored for each device handle
- Controller now locked when device open, so manual lock/unlock are deprecated
- Recalibrate and Seek commands no longer require a disk in the drive
- Read/write commands now use caller-specified buffer for size codes > 7
- Fixed access to sector id 255, which was returning ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER
- Fixed crash when reading/writing sectors with size codes >= 32
- Fixed possible crash if device was in use across a driver restart/update
- Fixed Configure and Specify commands, which checked the input buffer against pointer size instead of structure size!
- Missing data field is now reported as ERROR_SECTOR_NOT_FOUND instead of ERROR_CRC
- ReadId now resturns ERROR_CRC for CRC errors, instead of reporting as ERROR_SECTOR_NOT_FOUND
- Improved index sync, for better support of small sector sizes and early track starts
- Updated header to use only fixed size types, for 64-bit compatibility
- Removed cyl value from FD_SCAN_PARAMS structure, but still allow old-style calls for compatibility
- Added head tracking for safer seek bounds checking
- Added sector sync for duplicate sector id support
- Added support for custom head-settle times, for optimal use of modern drives
- Added support for reading count of unprocessed controller data
- Added timed track scanning to allow sector positions to be determined
- Added short-write support for truncated sectors, CRC errors, weak sectors, etc.


Version 1.0.0.19 (2005-07-08)
-----------------------------
- First public release
