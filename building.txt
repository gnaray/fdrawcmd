Switching off the "Treat warnings as errors" is not mandatory
anymore because the while(constant) loops are replaced with
for loops.

Building the fdrawcmd.sys file is not trivial.

It requires Windows 10 SDK, Windows 10 WDK, and the
ntddfdc.h which comes from Windows DDK (for example
Windows Server 2003 DDK (5.2.3790)) as a helper file (located at
c:\WINDDK\3790.1830\src\storage\fdc\inc\ntddfdc.h).
The SDK version must match the WDK version.
See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/other-wdk-downloads
The SDK version (e.g. 10.0.14393.795) is for targeted Windows 10, version 1607.
The WDK version (10.0.14393.0) is selected accordingly on that webpage.

For successful build the "Treat warnings as errors" must be switched off
because there is 3 warnings about do while(constant) loop.
